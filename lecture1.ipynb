    "## History\n",
    "People have been interested in the Universe for a long time. It started small, when people were tracking planetary motions in the years BCE. The first estimate for the Earth radius happend already in 240 BCE by Eratosthenes. Although he used different distance units, common for the time (stadia), for which we don't have exact conversion rate to metric, he could estimate the Earth radius ~1-2% error compared to todays known value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the history starts long ago, the modern cosmology starts in the early 1900s. One key aspect is the Einstein's general relativity theory, which is also base for todays discoveries. But theory itself is not enough. Another very import aspect is the experiment. Einstein's theory wouldn't have been successful if Eddington wouldn't have proved it in 29th May 1919. Decade later it was proposed by Georges Lemaître and 2 years later confirmed by Edwin Hubble, that more recessional velocity of a galaxy depends on the distance to Earth. So it was the early 1900s when we started to have better theory and also more data about the Universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another big discovery was done by accident in the 1960s by Americans Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson. The discovery was made with a antenna made for detecting radio waves for another project. They saw, that signal was stronger than expected and ruled out possibilities of hardware malfunction and static noise. The signal kept \"noisy\". Later they were put into contact with Robert H. Dicke, astrophysicist 60km away whos reasearch group had a plan to start detecting CMB signals. They estimated that the signal corresponds to 3.5 K background. Later measurements have measured CMB more precisely:\n",
